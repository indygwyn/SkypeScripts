## Synopsis

AppleScripts to Switch Audio inputs easily, I use them from QuickSilver, but it's probably easy to do the same from Alfred or Launchbar

## Motivation

I don't like digging in Preferences to swap between my wireless and wired headsets

## Installation

Put AppleScripts in ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Skype/
    you can enable the Scripting menu for access, or launch them via QuickSilver, Alfred or LaunchBar
